# Abhishek Singh | Product Manager Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website!  
This is a modern, single-page web application designed to showcase my experience, case studies, and contact information as a Product Manager. The site was designed and built entirely using Google's Gemini Canvas and Gemini AI, focusing on clarity, accessibility, and a seamless user experience.

## 🤖 AI Chat Assistant

The floating chat assistant uses Gemini's API (see JavaScript at the bottom of `index.html`).  
- By default, the API key is blank for privacy/security. You can add your own Gemini API key to enable live responses.
- The assistant is seeded with my resume and project info, and can answer questions about my career and skills.
